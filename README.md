What does HTML stand for?
HyperText Markup Language
What is the syntax for writing HTML?
HTML uses tags to mark up content; most elements will have an opening tag and a closing tag. EG:<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
Explain what <head> and <body> are and what they should contain.
<head> contains all the metadata in the website. This data isn't seen on the webpage, but includes <title> shown on the browser or links to style sheets. <body> contains all of the visible parts of the webpage, such as the paragraphs or images.
What are semantic elements, and why are they preferable to regular HTML elements?
Semantic elements have a clear meaning of what they contain, eg:<main> is the main page content. This is preferable to HTML elements as it's easier to read.
What is the DOM?
Document Object Model, a representation of the HTML document, its almost like a tree-like structure that browsers create when they load a webpage.
